<div class="tem4"></div>
<div class="tem3"><h2>EXOSKELETON</h2></div>
<div class="tem5"><p>Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for <br> ultimate durability and passenger protection. Starting <br> with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton, every <br> component is designed for superior strength and <br> endurance, from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel <br> structural skin to Tesla armor glass.</p></div>

<div class="tem8"><h2>ULTRA-HARD 30X COLD-ROLLED <br> STAINLESS STEEL</h2></div>
<div class="tem9"><p>If there was something better, we’d use it. Help eliminate <br> dents, damage and long-term corrosion with a smooth <br> monochrome exoskeleton that puts the shell on the <br> outside of the car and provides you and your passengers <br> maximum protection.</p></div>
<div class="tem10"><h2>VERSATILE UTILITY</h2></div>
<div class="tem11"><p>With up to 3,500 pounds of payload capacity and adjustable air suspension, Cybertruck is the most <br> powerful tool we have ever built, engineered with 100 cubic feet of exterior, lockable storage — including a <br> magic tonneau cover that is strong enough to stand on.</p></div>
<div class="tem12"><img src="./assets/img/6.png" alt=""></div>
<div class="tem13"><h2>VAULT-LIKE STORAGE</h2></div>
<div class="tem14"><p>Space for your toolbox, tire and Cyberquad, with room to spare. Utilize 100 cubic feet of exterior, lockable <br> storage — including the under-bed, frunk and sail pillars.</p></div>
<div class="tem15"><img src="./assets/img/8.png" alt=""></div>
<div class="tem16"><h2>PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY</h2></div>
<div class="tem17"><p>Now entering a new class of strength, speed and versatility—only possible with an all-electric design. The <br> powerful drivetrain and low center of gravity provides extraordinary traction control and torque—enabling <br> acceleration from 0-60 mph in as little as 2.9 seconds and up to 500 miles of range.</p></div>
